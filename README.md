# Question and Problem Definition
Given a training dataset listing passengers who either survived or didn't survive the Titanic disaster, can our model predict, using a test dataset that lacks survival information, whether these passengers survived?

## We decide to deploy the following workflow stages

1. **Define the question or problem.**
2. **Gather training and testing data.**
3. **Organize, prepare, and purify the data.**
4. **Analyze, recognize patterns, and explore the data.**
5. **Model, forecast, and address the problem.**
6. **Visualize, document, and present the steps of problem-solving and the ultimate solution.**
7. **Provide the results.**

## Workflow Goals

- **Classifying.** Our aim might be to classify or categorize our samples, and to understand the impact or correlation of various classes with our solution goal.

- **Correlating.** The approach could involve analyzing available features in the training dataset to determine which ones significantly contribute to our solution goal. It is important to evaluate whether there is a statistical correlation between a feature and the solution outcome and if changes in feature values alter the solution state and vice versa. This assessment is valid for both numerical and categorical features in the dataset. It also involves exploring correlations between features that go beyond survival to aid further goals and workflow stages.

- **Converting.** The modeling phase requires data preparation, where depending on the model algorithm, features might need to be converted to numerical equivalents, such as converting categorical text values to numbers.

- **Completing.** Preparing data may also involve estimating missing values within a feature since model algorithms typically perform best when no values are missing.

- **Correcting.** The training dataset might be scrutinized for errors or potentially inaccurate values within features, aiming to correct these values or exclude the samples that contain these errors. This could involve identifying outliers among our samples or features, or completely discarding a feature if it doesn't contribute to the analysis or might significantly skew the results.

- **Creating.** There may be opportunities to create new features based on an existing feature or a group of features, ensuring the new feature aligns with correlation, conversion, and completeness objectives.

- **Charting.** The selection of appropriate visualization plots and charts depends on the nature of the data and the solution goals.
