## Question and Problem Definition
Given a training dataset listing passengers who either survived or didn't survive the Titanic disaster, can our model predict, using a test dataset that lacks survival information, whether these passengers survived?

# We decide to deploy the following workflow stages

1. **Define the question or problem.**
2. **Gather training and testing data.**
3. **Organize, prepare, and purify the data.**
4. **Analyze, recognize patterns, and explore the data.**
5. **Model, forecast, and address the problem.**
6. **Visualize, document, and present the steps of problem-solving and the ultimate solution.**
7. **Provide the results.**
